# Tutorial 1

The idea of this tutorial is to showcase the power of pydantic. So my idea is to actually show case an already implemented code
without any pydantic type checking or validation and then to show how we can improve it with pydantic.

Start with the setup for both virutalenv and conda.

## Setup


### Virtualenv

https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install pydantic
```

### Conda
